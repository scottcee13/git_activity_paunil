> GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing developers to store, share, and collaborate on code projects. It provides tools for version control, teamwork, and project management — such as pull requests, issues, and branches. In short, GitHub makes it easy for people to work together on coding projects from anywhere.
